### Hello! I'm JosÃ© MarcosðŸ‘‹
<h5> I am a Java mid-level developer, specializing in the Spring ecosystem (Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring MVC) for building efficient, scalable, and secure REST APIs. I actively work with relational databases and schema versioning using Liquibase, applying best practices such as Test First, SOLID principles, Design Patterns, and Clean Architecture.

On the frontend, I use Angular to develop dynamic and responsive interfaces, integrating REST APIs with Angular HTTPClient and leveraging concepts like Angular Forms, validations, Standalone Components, and Bootstrap to optimize the user experience.

I have experience in state management and authentication handling with JWT, as well as implementing caching, structured logging, and monitoring to enhance system performance and traceability. I am constantly improving my skills and applying best development practices, focusing on clean architecture, security, and code optimization.

Currently, I am dedicated to refining my skills to tackle more complex technical challenges and contribute to the growth of innovative projects. ðŸš€.<h5/>
